**Chapter 3** 

The NSquare puzzle solver finds the solution to a simple nxn n-square puzzle. A nxn n-square puzzle contains (n\*\*2)-1 tiles in a n\*\*2 square grid labeled with the numbers 1-8. Tiles adjacent to the empty space can be moved into the space. The goal is to randomly move the pieces from the initial state and then attempt to get them back into the initial positions.

This project implements a breadth-first search and an A* search to solve the puzzle. 

The purpose of this project was for me to brush up on my C++ skills.
After many years of Java development, I needed to remind myself how to worry about pointers and memory management.
